The vending machine top module can be seen in the attached screenshots.The vending  machine has two money inputs for 25 cents and 1 dollar (100 cents). Here, the reader can assume that the actual machine has
one input for coins. However, 25 cents and 1 dollar are differentiated by a mechanism. Hence, we see two inputs.  The user can select a product by its corresponding button. After the selection, the user should press the buy button to finalize the operation. The vending machine
gives signal when a product goes out of stock. Then, it can be filled filed by  the corresponding tray and update the stock number by a button.The vending machine is capable of
offering four different products. Each product tray can keep up to 15 items.Seven segement decoder code is also used in this project to display the items.
